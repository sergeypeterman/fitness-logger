As an frontend developer and fitness enthusiast, I created a pet-project using Next.js and React to make tracking my workouts easier. The project utilizes Google Sheets as a database and features a simple interface that allows me to select a pre-designed fitness program from a Google Sheet and enter specific details for each exercise, such as sets, repetitions, and rest periods.

Using Next.js's serverless function and encryption, I ensured that my Google API keys were stored securely. The project allows me to easily retrieve a list of exercises from the sheet and input my workout data, with the ability to upload it to the sheet upon completion.

This project was developed for my personal use but has since served as a valuable demonstration of my ability to effectively utilize popular frontend technologies to develop practical applications. I am excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your IT team and continue developing my abilities as a frontend developer.
